I am a 3rd year Ph.D. student at [Web Science and Social Computing research group](https://www.upf.edu/web/wssc) of Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona working under the supervision of Prof. [Carlos Castillo](https://chato.cl/research/). 

My main research interests are Crisis Informatics and Data Science for Social Good, focusing on Multilingual Information Extraction.

I received my Master's Degree (with honors) in Computational linguistics from the National Research University Higher School of Economics under the supervision of Prof. Nikolay Karpov with a dissertation titled "Deep Semantics in Expert Finding Systems." We proposed an LSI-based topic similarity search model for authors of academic publications.

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked in [Havas Media Russia](https://ru.havas.com/havas-media/), [Ailove](https://ailove.ru/) and [CMG](https://convergent-usa.com/).
